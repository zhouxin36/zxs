# 290. Word Pattern(单词匹配)
* Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.
* Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.
```text
Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true

Input:pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false

Input: pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: false

Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog"
Output: false
```
You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and str contains lowercase letters that may be separated by a single space.
