# 266. Palindrome Permutation 回文全排列
* Given a string, determine if a permutation of the string could form a palindrome.
```text
Input: "code"
Output: false

Input: "aab"
Output: true

Input: "carerac"
Output: true
```
Hint:

* Consider the palindromes of odd vs even length. What difference do you notice?
* Count the frequency of each character.
* If each character occurs even number of times, then it must be a palindrome. How about character which occurs odd number of times?
