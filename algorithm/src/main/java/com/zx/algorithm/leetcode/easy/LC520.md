# 520. Detect Capital(检测大写)
* Given a word, you need to judge whether the usage of capitals in it is right or not.
* We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:
    * All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".
    * All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".
    * Only the first letter in this word is capital, like "Google".
* Otherwise, we define that this word doesn't use capitals in a right way.
 ```text
Input: "USA"
Output: True
 
Input: "FlaG"
Output: False
```
* Note: The input will be a non-empty word consisting of uppercase and lowercase latin letters.
