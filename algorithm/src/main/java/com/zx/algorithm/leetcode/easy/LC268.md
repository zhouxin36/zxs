# 268. Missing Number(缺失数字)
* Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.
```text
Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2

Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
```
Note:
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?
