# 409. Longest Palindrome
* Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.
* This is case sensitive, for example "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.
```text
Input:
"abccccdd"
Output:
7
```
* Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.
* One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
