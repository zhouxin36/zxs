# [594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence 最长和谐子序列](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-harmonious-subsequence/)
* We define a harmounious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.
* Now, given an integer array, you need to find the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.
```text
Input: [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
```
Note: The length of the input array will not exceed 20,000.
