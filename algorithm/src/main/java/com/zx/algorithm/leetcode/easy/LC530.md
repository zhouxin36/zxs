* Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, find the minimum absolute difference between values of any two nodes.
```text
Input:

   1
    \
     3
    /
   2

Output:
1

Explanation:
The minimum absolute difference is 1, which is the difference between 2 and 1 (or between 2 and 3).
```
* There are at least two nodes in this BST.
